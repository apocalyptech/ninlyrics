* Javascript highlighting of lyrics
* Error reporting on invalid search variables (text, most notably)
* Sorting
* Prettification
* DB Error reporting
* Add "total" #Songs and #Albums columns when searching by album
* Drop out of "complex" SQL mode if literally every album is selected
* Make sure that data_do_search() fails gracefully when passed in
  album IDs which don't exist.
* Clean up the actual lyric data, of course.
* Notification of search constraints which don't work well together
  (like specifying two albums and then saying that the phrase must
  be in a minimum of three, etc)
