* Javascript highlighting of lyrics
* Error reporting on invalid search variables (text, most notably)
* Prettification
* DB Error reporting
* Drop out of "complex" SQL mode if literally every album is selected
* Make sure that data_do_search() fails gracefully when passed in
  album IDs which don't exist.
* Clean up the actual lyric data, of course.
* Notification of search constraints which don't work well together
  (like specifying two albums and then saying that the phrase must
  be in a minimum of three, etc)
* Probably should reset paging when sorts change?
* The sort arrows might make more sense the other way around?
* Disabled albums_restrict checkbox doesn't carry over between
  requests...

* We might be over-pruning our phrase list.  For example, a search
  for "button" will yield three phrases, all from Capital G:
    "he pushed a button and it dropped a bomb"
    "i pushed a button and elected him to office and ah"
    "you pushed a button and could watch it on the television"
  ... but there's no phrase in the DB for just "pushed a button and"
  itself, which despite being an "unimportant" subphrase of each of
  those main phrases, is still shared between them, which might be
  something important to catalog.  It's not entirely important, really,
  as that kind of pruning wouldn't happen for phrases between songs,
  but maybe we should alter things anyway...
