* Javascript highlighting of lyrics
* Error reporting on invalid search variables (text, most notably)
* Sorting
* Prettification
* DB Error reporting
* Drop out of "complex" SQL mode if literally every album is selected
* Make sure that data_do_search() fails gracefully when passed in
  album IDs which don't exist.
* Clean up the actual lyric data, of course.
* Notification of search constraints which don't work well together
  (like specifying two albums and then saying that the phrase must
  be in a minimum of three, etc)

* Okay, okay...  The interaction of the album select box and the rest
  of the aggregate stats needs to be clarified and expanded.  I think
  most notably, the albumcount and songcount numbers need to have options
  to specify whether they apply to ONLY the specific albums selected,
  or if they can apply to all albums.  Case in point, if you select
  (TDS, 2songs, 5words), you'll see "nothing can stop me now" in the
  list.  That appears in TDS, Fragile, and WT.  If you change th album
  dropdown to just Fragile, or just WT (while leaving 2songs+5words),
  you won't see it in the list because the phrase only appears in ONE
  song for each of those albums.  That makes *sense* but I think it'll
  end up being counterintuitive.
