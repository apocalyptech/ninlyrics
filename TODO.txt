Would like to have:

* Javascript highlighting of lyrics?  Not sure about this, actually.
* Error reporting on invalid search variables (text, most notably)
  - I'm actually probably gonna leave that the way it is.
* Prettification
* DB Error reporting
* Clean up the actual lyric data, of course.
* Notification of search constraints which don't work well together
  (like specifying two albums and then saying that the phrase must
  be in a minimum of three, etc)
* Probably should reset paging when sorts change?

Things which probably won't happen:

* We might be over-pruning our phrase list.  For example, a search
  for "button" will yield three phrases, all from Capital G:
    "he pushed a button and it dropped a bomb"
    "i pushed a button and elected him to office and ah"
    "you pushed a button and could watch it on the television"
  ... but there's no phrase in the DB for just "pushed a button and"
  itself, which despite being an "unimportant" subphrase of each of
  those main phrases, is still shared between them, which might be
  something important to catalog.  It's not entirely important, really,
  as that kind of pruning wouldn't happen for phrases between songs,
  but maybe we should alter things anyway...
* Make sure that data_do_search() fails gracefully when passed in
  album IDs which don't exist.  (This actually isn't *really* a
  problem because the one place where we call data_do_search() already
  verifies the the album IDs are valid, so the app as a whole handles
  it just fine.  I think we'd have broken SQL were an invalid album
  ID make it in to data_do_search() but in the end I'm just going to
  leave it.)
