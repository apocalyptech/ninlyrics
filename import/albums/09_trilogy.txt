Album: Not The Actual Trilogy
Year: 2017

Song: Branches/Bones

    Still can make out pieces with the opening sewed shut
    Yeah, parts of me are slowing down and time is speeding up
    Spiders crawling everywhere
    Infected Japanese
    You can tell all your friends you're just a tourist
    But you can't understand what they've planned until you try to leave

    Feels like I've been here before
    Yeah, I don't know anymore
    And I don't care anymore
    Feels like I've been here before

    Cold and black and infinite with nothing left to lose
    If you try to keep the flies away
    The makeup hides the bruise
    Her branches are the bones that break
    Become a perfect line
    And no, he won't be just a man who's Sometimes
    He won't be just a man who's Sometimes

    Feels like I've been here before
    Yeah, I don't know anymore
    And I don't care anyway
    I think I recognize

    Yes, I have been here before
    Yeah, I don't care anymore
    Don't give a fuck anymore
    Yeah, I don't care

Song: Dear World,

    Yes, everyone seems to be asleep

    Hey look, you didn't even notice
    You couldn't even tell
    Just when it started happening
    Maybe just as well
    After all, everything is getting unfamiliar now
    Trajectory in decline
    And we become obsolete
    A frame at a time

    I'm locked inside here
    I have to stay
    With people who aren't here
    All the way
    Pictures and faces
    On display
    Of people who aren't here
    All the way

    And you didn't even notice
    And you didn't even notice
    That you're missing

    Dear world, I can hardly recognize you anymore
    And yet I remain certain there is an answer in you
    I feel like I have lived so long
    Sometimes run out of things to try to do
    I can't concentrate
    What about
    I begin to go through another that we have been
    I have been entirely patient
    No, no, not this time

    I am leaving because I can't recognize who I have been
    You go on spoiling
    It's happening
    Without me you didn't even notice
    Of course it's been happening all along
    Permanent intervals
    As you become obsolete
    Who are you?
    Oh, this place...
    I can't concentrate
    But I know I can't trust myself

    I'm locked inside here
    I have to stay
    With people who aren't here
    All the way
    Pictures and faces
    On display
    Of people who aren't here
    All the way

    Yes, everyone seems to be asleep

Song: She's Gone Away

    You dig in places till your fingers bleed
    Spread the infection where you spill your seed
    I can't remember what she came here for
    I can't remember much of anything anymore

    She's gone
    She's gone
    She's gone away

    A little mouth opened up inside
    Yeah, I was watching on the day she died
    We keep licking while the skin turns black
    Cut along the length
    But you can't get the feeling back

    She's gone
    She's gone
    She's gone away

    Are you still here?

Song: The Idea of You

    Maybe that was somebody else
    Maybe I was somebody else
    I'm sorry, for what it's worth
    If that means anything anymore
    I think there's something just wrong
    I have been wondering
    When, when did you know?
    You know, really know?
    No, no, no, no, I don't think that's going to happen here
    You missed all that on the way out
    Remember, I don't wanna remember anymore
    Maybe I was somebody else
    Just go back to the idea of me
    Just go back to the idea of me
    Just go back to the idea of me
    Just

    Wait
    Wake
    Breathe
    Believe
    Hey, you tell yourself

    None of this is happening

    Oh and if I start to tell you anything, please don't pay attention
    That's not really me in there
    I would never do that
    Just go back to the idea of me
    Go back to that idea
    Can you even hear me over here?
    Everything absorbing, liquid twitching, forming something terrible
    The sores are gone
    And you can hardly tell now but
    That was someone else who isn't here anymore

    Wait
    Wake
    Breathe
    Believe
    Hey, you tell yourself

    None of this is happening

    Wait
    Wake
    Breathe
    Believe
    Hey, you tell yourself

    Hey
    Can you hear?
    It gets
    So lonely in here

Song: Burning Bright (Field on Fire)

    I'm going back
    Of course I am
    As if I ever had a choice
    Back to what I always knew I was
    On the inside
    Back to what I really am
    Look at this pathetic place I made
    With little bits of sticks and hair
    And anything I found along the way
    And tell yourself, you know?
    You're not really what you know you are
    You know?
    Of course you do
    I think I may have even listened to you
    I think I may have even listened to you
    At the height of my demise

    Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
    Break through the surface and breathe

    I am forgiven
    I am free
    I am a field on fire

    And oh my God, I have missed you
    It has been so long
    And I am stronger than I have ever been in my decline
    I am stronger than I have ever been in my decline
    For now I know, now I know, now I know for certain
    Now I know for certain
    Oh, burn motherfucker
    Carry the carcass and throw it on
    Pull up a chair and watch
    The flies come roaring out
    And will surround the entire world
    And blacken out the sky and every last one of you
    Like a plague of locusts
    Like an exit
    Like an end
    Like an end
    Like an end
    Like the end

    Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe…
    Break through the surface and breathe

    I am forgiven
    I am free
    I am a field on fire

    I can't tell if I am dreaming anymore

Song: Less Than

    Focus? 
    We didn't even notice 
    We awake in a place we can barely recognize, yeah 
    Hypnosis
    And you can justify it all
    Your back was up against the wall again
    (Shut up)
    Silence 
    Add a little violence 
    And offend and pretend and defend and demand my compliance 
    And you can always justify the missile trails across the sky 
    Again

    So what are you waiting for? 
    You got what you asked for 
    Did it fix what was wrong with you? 
    Are you less than? 
    Go and look what you gone done 
    Welcome oblivion 
    Did it fix what was wrong with you? 
    Are you less than?

    Needful 
    Too many fucking people 
    You'll have to take care of yourselves
    (You know I've got my hands full)
    And you can always justify the missile trails across the sky 
    Again

    So what are you waiting for? 
    You got what you asked for 
    Did it fix what was wrong with you? 
    Are you less than? 
    Go and look what you gone done 
    Come on welcome oblivion 
    Did it fix what was wrong inside?
    Are you less than?

Song: The Lovers

    (I can hear you breathing)
    I've slipped out of time again
    Leaving all of you behind
    And I'm free
    To return to the place where I already am
    And have always been 
    If I just really looked and allowed myself to see

    The confusion is seducing me warm, flowing
    Wide his eyes
    Summer
    Hypnotize they see inside of me
    Hot swollen skin want me take me perfect embrace 
    Black and bloody
    Rotten and perfect
    The center has moved on and all that's left is free 
    Finally 
    Finally 
    Everyone seems to be asleep but me 

    Take me into the arms of the lovers
    Free
    Take me into the arms of the lovers

    Oh I see you floating there
    How could I ever hope to forget
    Always rearranging
    These words are a lie
    A mirror reflecting in a mirror of a lie
    A light shines still always 
    Shadows in every word 
    Beneath black eaves
    Please don't leave me here
    I could stop it 
    Maybe I could stop it (if I wanted to)
    But I'm not the one driving anymore
    I know who I am
    But I know who I am
    Right?
    (Please don't leave me here with you)

    Take me into the arms of the lovers
    Free into the arms of the lovers
    Into the arms of the lovers
    Please
    Into the arms of the lovers

    I am free
    Into the arms of the lovers

Song: This Isn't the Place

    And if you see my friend
    I thought I would again
    A single thin straight line
    I thought we had more time
    Carry me 
    Carry me home

Song: Not Anymore

    Surprise
    I must have let it get in
    Started to turn into somebody else
    Yeah I found myself believing
    Tick tock tick
    Time
    My feet are nailed to the floor
    I always thought we would get there somehow
    I always thought there'd be more

    Well not anymore
    Well not anymore
    Well not anymore

    Mouth taped shut
    Crippled and frozen with fear
    That maybe happens to somebody else
    No that doesn't happen round here
    I won't forget I know who I am
    No matter what I know who I am
    And what I'm doing this for

    Well not anymore
    Well not anymore
    Well not anymore
    And I can't seem to wake up

Song: The Background World

    You left me here 
    What am I supposed to do? 
    I never dared to look inside 
    Just like you told me to 
    I'm going into you again 
    And I know you saw it too 
    And I will keep myself awake 
    I know what's coming
    I feel it reaching through 
    There is no moving past 
    There is no better place 
    There is no future point in time 
    We will not get away 

    The world is bleeding out 
    It folds itself in two  
    Behind the background world 
    Is always bleeding through 

    Are you sure this is what you want?
    As hard as you try not to see it

Song: Shit Mirror

    Got a new face and it feels all right
    Power and strength and appetite
    I eat your loathing hate and fear
    Should probably stay away from here

    Hey look what’s staring back at you
    Caught reflecting in your eyes
    Well I’m becoming something new
    It’s getting hard to recognize  

    New world 
    New times
    Mutation

    I tried a bit then I tried some more
    I left her on the bathroom floor
    I think I knew when it crossed the line
    I think I knew the whole goddamned time

    Hey look what’s staring back at you
    Caught reflecting in your eyes
    I’m becoming something new
    It’s getting hard to recognize

    New world
    New times
    Mutation

    Feels all right

Song: Ahead of Ourselves

    Everything all figured out
    Like it was meant to be
    We’re on the precipice (I can feel it)
    We’re on the precipice
    Created us in his image
    Better be proud of his work
    That is if he existed (not so sure anymore)
    That is if he existed

    And we just can’t help ourselves
    And we just can’t help ourselves
    And we just can’t help ourselves
    And we just can’t help ourselves (I don’t think that’s me)

    Obsolete
    Insignificant
    Antiquated 
    Irrelevant
    Celebration of ignorance
    Why try change when you know you can’t?

    Did you ever get that feeling?
    Man I can’t seem to shake it
    Not quite as clever as we think we are
    Knuckle dragging animal
    When we could have done anything
    We wound up building this we deserve
    With illusions of enlightenment
    With our snouts in the dirt
    With our snouts in the dirt

    Obsolete
    Insignificant
    Antiquated 
    Irrelevant
    Celebration of ignorance
    Why try change when you know you can’t?

    We got ahead of ourselves
    We got ahead of ourselves
    We got ahead of ourselves
    We got ahead of ourselves

Song: God Break Down the Door

    God break down the door
    God break down the door
    You won't find the answers here
    Not the ones you came looking for

    God break down the door
    Everything all at once
    There aren't any answers here
    No, no, not anymore

    God break down the door
    God break down the door
    You won't find the answers here
    Not the ones you came looking for

    God break down the door
    Everything all at once
    There aren't any answers here
    No, no

    Remove the pain and push it back in
    Remove the pain and push it back in
    Remove the pain and push it back in (Remove the pain and push it back in)
    Remove the pain and push it back in (Remove the pain and push it back in)

    Remove the pain and push it back in (Remove the pain and push it back in)
    Remove the pain and push it back in (Remove the pain and push it back in)
    Remove the pain and push it back in (Pull it out, push it back, pull it out, push it back)
    Remove the pain and push it back in (Pull it out, push it back, pull it out, push it back)  

    Remove the pain and push it back in

Song: I'm Not From This World

    I'm not from this world
    Not anymore

Song: Over And Out

    Time is running out
    I don’t know what I’m waiting for

    I think this keeps happening over and over again
    Feel like I’ve been here before
    Over and over again
    Am I remembering you correctly
    Over and over again

    I’ve always been ten years ahead of you
    Over and over again
