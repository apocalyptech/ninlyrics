Song: Head Like A Hole

    God Money I'll do anything for you
    God Money just tell me what you want me to
    God Money nail me up against the wall
    God Money don't want everything he wants it all
    No you can't take it
    No no you can't take it
    (You can't take that away from me)
    
    Head like a hole
    Black as your soul
    I'd rather die than give you control
    Head like a hole
    Black as your soul
    I'd rather die than give you control
    
    Bow down before the one you serve
    You're going to get what you deserve
    
    God Money's not looking for the cure
    God Money's not concerned about the sick among the pure
    God Money let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised
    God Money's not one to choose
    No you can't take it
    No no you can't take it
    No you can't take that away from me
    
    Head like a hole
    Black as your soul
    I'd rather die than give you control
    Head like a hole
    Black as your soul
    I'd rather die than give you control
    
    Bow down before the one you serve
    You're going to get what you deserve

Song: Terrible Lie

    Hey God, why are you doing this to me?
    Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?
    Why am I seething with this animosity?
    Hey God, I think you owe me a great big apology
    
    Terrible lie
    
    Hey God, I really don't know what you mean
    Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams
    I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
    Hey God, can this world really be as sad as it seems?
    
    Terrible lie
    
    Don't take it away from me
    I need someone to hold on to
    Don't take it away from me
    I need someone to hold on to
    
    Hey God, there's nothing left for me to hide
    I lost my ignorance, security and pride
    I'm all alone in a world you must despise
    Hey God, I believed your promises, your promises and lies
    
    Terrible lie
    
    You made me throw it all away
    My morals left to decay
    How many you betray
    You've taken everything
    
    Terrible lie
    
    My head is filled with disease
    My skin is begging you please
    I'm on my hands and knees
    I want so much to believe
    I need someone to hold on to
    I need someone to hold on to
    I need someone to hold on to
    I need someone to hold on to
    I give you everything
    My sweet everything

Song: Down In It

    Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky and I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
    Sometimes I can't believe them myself and I decided I was never coming down
    Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye it was just about too small to see
    But I watched it way too long and that dot was pulling me down
    
    I was up above it
    Now I'm down in it
    
    Well shut up so what what does it matter now
    I was swimming in the haze now I crawl on the ground
    And everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me
    Try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out
    ("I guess the joke's on me," she said)
    
    I was up above it
    Now I'm down in it
    
    I used to be so big and strong
    I used to know my right from wrong
    I used to never be afraid
    I used to be somebody
    I used to have something inside
    Now just this hole that's open wide
    I used to want it all
    I used to be somebody
    
    I'll cross my heart and hope to die but the needle's already in my eye
    And all the world's weight is on my back and I don't even know why
    And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory
    I looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye"
    
    I was up above it
    Now I'm down in it

    Rain rain go away, come again some other day.

Song: Sanctified

    It's still getting worse after everything I've tried
    What if I found a way to wash it all aside
    What if she touches with those fingertips
    As the words spill out like fire from her lips

    If she says come inside I'll come inside for her
    If she says give it all I'll give everything to her
    I am justified
    I am purified
    I am sanctified
    Inside you

    Heaven's just a rumor she'll dispel
    As she walks me through the nicest parts of Hell
    I still dream of lips I never should have kissed
    Well she knows exactly what I can't resist

    If she says come inside I'll come inside for her
    If she says give it all I'll give everything to her
    I am justified
    I am purified
    I am sanctified
    Inside you

    I'm just caught up in another of her spells
    She's turning me into someone else
    Every day I hope and pray that this will end
    But when I can I do it all again

    If she says come inside I'll come inside for her
    If she says give it all I'll give everything to her
    I am justified
    I am purified
    I am sanctified
    Inside you

Song: Something I Can Never Have

    I still recall the taste of your tears
    Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
    My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
    Scraping through my head till I don't want to sleep anymore
    
    Come on tell me
    Make this all go away
    You make this all go away
    I'm down to just one thing and I'm starting to scare myself
    Make this all go away
    You make this all go away
    I just want something
    I just want something I can never have
    
    You always were the one to show me how
    Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now
    This thing is slowly taking me apart
    Grey would be the color if I had a heart
    
    I just want something I can never have
    
    In this place it seems like such a shame
    Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
    Everywhere I look you're all I see
    Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be
    
    Come on tell me
    Make this all go away
    You make this all go away
    I'm down to just one thing and I'm starting to scare myself
    Make this all go away
    You make this all go away
    I just want something
    I just want something I can never have
    I just want something I can never have

Song: Kinda I Want To

    I can't shake this feeling from my head
    There's a devil sleeping in my bed
    He's watching you from across the way
    I cannot make this feeling go away
    
    I know it's not the right thing
    And I know it's not the good thing
    But kinda I want to
    
    I'm not sure of what I should do
    When every thought I'm thinking of is you
    All of my excuses turn to lies
    Maybe God will cover up His eyes
    
    I know it's not the right thing
    And I know it's not the good thing
    But kinda I want to
    Kinda I want to
    
    Maybe just for tonight
    We can pretend it's all right
    What's the price I pay?
    I don't care what they say
    I want to
    I want to (I'll take my chance tonight)

Song: Sin

    You give me the reason                        
    You give me control
    I gave you my Purity
    My Purity you stole
    Did you think I wouldn't recognize this compromise?
    Am I just too stupid to realize?
    Stale incense, old sweat and lies, lies, lies
    
    It comes down to this
    Your kiss
    Your fist
    And your strain
    It gets under my skin
    Within
    Take in
    The extent of my sin
    
    You give me the anger
    You give me the nerve
    Carry out my sentence
    I get what I deserve
    I'm just an effigy to be defaced
    To be disgraced
    Your need for me has been replaced
    And if I can't have everything well then just give me a taste
    
    It comes down to this
    Your kiss
    Your fist
    And your strain
    It gets under my skin
    Within
    Take in
    The extent of my sin

Song: That's What I Get

    Just when everything was making sense
    You took away all my self-confidence
    Now all that I've been hearing must be true
    I guess I'm not the only boy for you
    
    That's what I get
    
    How could you turn us into this
    After you just taught me how to kiss you?
    I told you I'd never say goodbye
    Now I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry
    
    That's what I get
    
    Why does it come as a surprise?
    To think that I was so na√Øve
    Maybe didn't mean so much
    But it meant everything to me

Song: The Only Time

    I'm drunk
    And right now I'm so in love with you
    And I don't want to think too much about what we should or shouldn't do
    Lay my hands on Heaven and the sun and the moon and the stars
    While the Devil wants to fuck me in the back of his car
    Nothing quite like the feel of something new
    
    Maybe I'm all messed up
    Maybe I'm all messed up in you
    
    But this is the only time I really feel alive
    This is the only time I really feel alive
    
    I swear
    I just found everything I need
    The sweat in your eyes the blood in your veins are listening to me
    Well I want to rip it up and swim in it until I drown
    My moral standing is lying down
    Nothing quite like the feel of something new
    
    Maybe I'm all messed up
    Maybe I'm all messed up in you
    
    But this is the only time I really feel alive
    This is the only time I really feel alive

Song: Ringfinger

    Well you've got me working so hard lately
    Working my hands until they bleed
    If I was twice the man I could be
    I'd still be half of what you need
    Still you lead me and I follow
    Anything you ask you know I'll do
    But this one act of consecration is what I ask of you
    
    Ringfinger
    Promise carved in stone
    Deeper than the sea
    Ringfinger
    Sever flesh and bone
    And offer it to me
    
    You just leave me nailed here
    Hanging like Jesus on this cross
    I'm just dying for your sins
    And aiding to the cause
    
    Ringfinger
    Promise carved in stone
    Deeper than the sea
    Ringfinger
    Sever flesh and bone
    And offer it to me
    
    Wrap my eyes in bandages
    Confessions I see through
    I get everything I want
    When I get part of you
    
    Ringfinger
    Promise carved in stone
    Deeper than the sea
    Ringfinger
    Sever flesh and bone
    And offer it to me
    Ringfinger
    Promise carved in stone
    Deeper than the sea
    Ringfinger
    Devil's flesh and bone
    Do something for me
