Song: Copy Of A

   I am just a copy of a copy of a copy
   Everything I say has come before
   Assembled into something into something into something
   I don't know for certain anymore
   I am just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
   Always trying to catch up with myself
   I am just an echo of an echo of an echo
   Listening to someone's cry for help
   
   Look what you had to start
   Why all the change of heart?
   You need to play your part
   A copy of a copy of a
   Now look what you've gone and done
   Well that doesn't sound like fun
   See I'm not the only one
   Copy of a copy of a
   
   I am little pieces little pieces little pieces
   Pieces that we picked up on the way
   Imprinted with a purpose with a purpose with a purpose
   A purpose that's become quite clear today
   
   I am just a finger on a trigger on a finger
   Doing everything I'm told to do
   Always my intention my intention your attention
   Doing everything you tell me to
   
   Look what you had to start
   Why all the change of heart?
   You need to play your part
   A copy of a copy of a
   Now look what you've gone and done
   Well that doesn't sound like fun
   See I'm not the only one
   Copy of a copy of a

Song: Came Back Haunted

   The throat is deep and the mouth is wide
   Saw some things on the other side
   Made me promise to never tell
   You know me I can't help myself, no
   Now I got something you have to see
   They put something inside of me
   Its smile is red and its eyes are black
   I don't think I'll be coming back
   
   I don't believe and I
   I had to see
   Came back haunted
   Came back haunted
   I said goodbye and I
   I had to try and I
   Came back haunted
   Came back haunted
   
   Everywhere now reminding me
   I am not who I used to be
   I'm afraid this has just begun
   Consequences for what I've done
   
   I don't believe and I
   I had to see
   Came back haunted
   Came back haunted
   I said goodbye and I
   I had to try and I
   Came back haunted
   Came back haunted
   You tried to tell me but I
   I couldn't stop myself now I
   Came back haunted
   Came back haunted
   
   Just can't stop
   Came back haunted

Song: Find My Way

   Lord my path has gone astray
   I'm just trying to find my way
   Wandered here from far away
   I'm just trying to find my way
   You were never meant to see
   All those things inside of me
   Now that you have gone away
   I'm just trying to find my way
   
   I have made a great mistake
   Pray the Lord my soul to take
   The ghosts of who I used to be
   I can feel them come for me
   It looks as though they're here to stay
   I'm just trying to find my way
   
   Please
   I never meant to
   I never meant for this
   
   I have been to every place
   I have been to everywhere
   I'm just trying to find my way
   Oh dear Lord hear my prayer

Song: All Time Low

   Go
   I've heard all I need to know
   Your voice in fucking echo stereo
   Well this particular scenario
   Looks like another all time low
   Why did you go and let them in?
   See this is where the fun begins
   You barely even pierced the skin
   Just wait till you see what is coming
   
   Get down on the floor
   Shut the god damn door
   Been down this road before
   We're coming back for more
   
   So give me just a little, baby
   Just something to get by
   This is gonna last forever, baby
   We'll get to the other side
   And we will live forever, baby
   And stretch across the sky
   I'll follow right behind you, baby
   We are never gonna die
   
   Hey
   Everything is not okay
   We lost too much along the way
   The passengers arrived today
   It looks as though they're here to stay
   This paranoia turns to fear
   Just who was whispering in your ear?
   Pretending, but I know you hear
   (Just how'd we fucking end up here?)
   
   So give me just a little, baby
   Just something to get by
   This is gonna last forever, baby
   We'll get to the other side
   And we will live forever, baby
   And stretch across the sky
   I'll follow right behind you, baby
   We are never gonna die
   
   We're never gonna die
   How did we get so high?

Song: Disappointed

   If I were you
   I wouldn't trust a single word I say
   Think by now you should know
   Nothing's going to change
   
   Can I ask you something?
   What did you expect?
   So disappointed with what you get
   Do you ever want to just get out of here?
   So disappointed
   You disappear
   
   Look at you
   Superman
   With all the world to save
   You think by now you'd figure out
   That's nothing's going to change
   (And I am part of the reason)
   
   Can I ask you something?
   What did you expect?
   So disappointed with what you get
   Do you ever want to just get out of here?
   So disappointed
   You disappear

Song: Everything

    I survived everything
    I have tried everything
    Everything
    And anything
    
    All the walls begin to dissolve away
    Feel your hands begin to shake
    And just who you think you used to be
    All begins to bend and break
    
    Wave goodbye
    Wish me well
    I've become something else
    Something else
    (Just as well, really)
    
    But this thing that lives inside of me
    Will surely rise and wake
    And his seed that bleeds right through to me
    As it comes to grab and take
    
    I am home
    I believe
    I am home
    I am free
    I am home
    I can see
    Always here
    Finally

Song: Satellite

   Data trails
   Like fingernails
   Scratch across the sky
   Hard to know
   Figure out
   Tell the truth from lies
   Everywhere
   Listening
   Every word you say
   Think I found
   A way around
   Yeah I think I found a way
   Well, come on
   
   Satellite
   I'm watching you
   I'm one step ahead
   Satellite
   I'm part of you
   I'm inside your head
   
   Yes we can
   Yes we did
   Eliminate the spread
   Better watch
   What you think
   What was that you said?
   Everywhere
   Everything
   Every word you say
   Think I found
   A way around
   Yeah I think I found
   A way
   
   I know you're up there somewhere
   So very high

Song: Various Methods of Escape

   Hallucinate in high fidelity
   Little pieces of a plan
   Construction of the highest quality
   The blood from my own hand
   A line of lyric looping in my head
   Nobody listening
   I guess it really doesn't matter anymore
   I guess it doesn't mean a thing
   
   I've got to let it go
   I've got to get straight
   Why'd you have to make it so hard?
   Let me get away
   
   An effigy so wondrous to behold
   A statement so profound
   A place to bury every thing I did
   And burn it to the ground
   The fire illuminates our final scene
   The past repeats itself
   I can not tell the difference anymore
   I can not trust myself
   
   I've got to let it go
   I've got to get straight
   Why'd you have to make it so hard?
   Let me get away

   I think I could lose myself in here
   
   I've got to let it go
   I've got to get straight
   Why'd you have to make it so hard?
   Let me get away
   
   Got to let him go
   Find another way
   Why'd you have to make it so hard?
   Let me get away

Song: Running

   I followed you again this morning
   Just close enough to feel you near
   Pretending everyone could see me
   Just slip away and disappear
   
   They're right behind
   They're so inclined
   They're all aligned
   We're undermined
   As good as blind
   I'm out of time
   So hard to find
   So well-defined
   They're all aligned
   They're intertwined
   We're undermined
   They're so inclined
   We're right behind
   So hard to find
   As good as blind
   I'm out of time
   
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this
   
   I had a friend I think who knew me
   I couldn't seem to make him stay
   I know they're watching waiting for me
   I know I'll never get away
   
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this
   I'm running out of places I can hide from this

Song: I Would For You

   What a pathetic string of words
   Just leave them lying on the floor
   The warning posted on the door
   Not over here not anymore
   There was a place that could have been
   Step over all that used to be
   Since you have let yourself come in
   Some things I'd rather you not see
   
   See I keep lying to myself
   Don't know what else there is to do
   If I could be somebody else
   Well, I think I would for you
   
   Didn't seem like something more?
   So long I can't remember when
   And this has happened all before
   And this will happen all again
   And I only have myself to blame
   And I only have myself to blame
   
   See I keep lying to myself
   Don't know what else there is to do
   If I could be somebody else
   Well, I think I would for you

Song: In Two

   Split
   Split into
   Something else
   Shed your precious skin
   Save yourself
   Bleed
   Have to purge what you were
   Yes
   Yes of course
   This is going to hurt
   Nature is violent
   The very nature of this is violence
   No no no no no that was someone else
   No no no no no no no that wasn't me
   
   It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
   It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
   I don't believe you can even remember which one you are
   It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
   
   Thrive
   Just become your disease
   Leave them behind
   You are free
   Take what you want
   What you deserve
   Yes
   Yes of course
   This is going to hurt
   
   It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
   It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
   I don't believe you can even remember which one you are
   It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
   
   I just don't know anymore
   I just don't know

Song: While I'm Still Here

   Only thing I've ever done
   Ticking time is running out
   Closest I have ever come
   Ticking time is running out
   Oh so tired on my own
   Ticking time is running out
   Best days I have ever known
   Ticking time is running out
   
   Yesterday, I found out the world was ending
   
   A little more
   Every day
   Falls apart
   Slips away
   Well I don't mind
   I'm okay
   Wish it didn't have to end this way
   
   These four walls are closing in
   Ticking time is running out
   Oh all the things that might have been
   Ticking time is running out
   Watch young lovers walking by
   Ticking time is running out
   God forgive me if I cry
   Ticking time is running out
   
   A little more
   Every day
   Falls apart
   Slips away
   I don't mind
   I'm okay
   Nothing ever
   Stays the same
   While we can
   Remember when
   We always were
   Yes, even then
   Stay with me
   Hold me near
   While I'm still here
