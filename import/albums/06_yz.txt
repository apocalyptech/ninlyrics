Song: The Beginning of the End

    Down on your knees, you'll be left behind
    This is the beginning 
    Watch what you think, they can read your mind
    This is the beginning
    I got my mark, see it in my eyes
    This is the beginning
    My reflection I don't recognize
    This is the beginning
   
    We think we climb so high
    Up all the backs we've condemned
    We face our consequence
    This is the beginning of the end
    
    You wait your turn, you'll be last in line
    This is the beginning
    Get out the way, 'cause I'm getting mine
    This is the beginning
    God helps the ones that can help themselves
    This is the beginning
    May be too late as far as I can tell
    This is the beginning
    
    We think we've come so far 
    On all our lies we depend 
    Facing our consequence
    This is the beginning of the end

Song: Survivalism

    I should have listened to her
    So hard to keep control
    We kept on eating
    But our bloated bellies still not full
    She gave us all she had but
    We went and took some more
    Can't seem to shut her legs
    Our Mother Nature is a whore
    
    I got my propaganda
    I got revisionism
    I got my violence in high def ultra-realism
    All a part of this great nation
    I got my fist
    I got my plan
    I got survivalism
    
    Hypnotic sound of sirens
    Echoing through the street
    The cocking of the rifles
    The marching of the feet
    You see your world on fire
    Don't try to act surprised
    We did just what you told us
    Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies
    
    I got my propaganda
    I got revisionism
    I got my violence in high def ultra-realism
    All a part of this great nation
    I got my fist
    I got my plan
    I got survivalism
    
    All bruised and broken, bleeding
    She asks to take my hand
    I turn just keep on walking
    But you'd do the same thing in the circumstance
    I'm sure you'll understand
    
    I got my propaganda
    I got revisionism
    I got my violence in high-def ultra-realism
    All a part of this great nation
    I got my fist
    I got my plan
    I got survivalism

Song: The Good Soldier

    Gun fire in the street
    Where we used to meet
    Echoes out a beat and the bass goes
    Bomb right over my head 
    Step over the dead 
    Remember what you said
    You know, the part about
    Life is just a waking dream 
    Well I know what you mean
    But that ain't how it seems right here right now
    How can all this be real
    I can barely feel anymore
    
    I am trying to see
    I am trying to believe 
    This is not where I should be 
    I am trying to believe 
    
    Blood hardens in the sand 
    Cold metal in my hand 
    Help you understand
    The way that things are gonna be
    There's nowhere left to hide 
    'Cause God is on our side 
    I keep telling myself
    
    I am trying to see 
    I am trying to believe 
    This is not where I should be 
    I am trying to believe

Song: Vessel

    I let you put it in my mouth
    I let it get under my skin
    I let you pump it through my veins
    I let you take me from within
    They tell us what we can and cannot do
    Same thing we've heard a hundred times before
    When I put you inside of me
    None of that matters anymore
    
    My God
    Can it go any faster?
    Oh my God
    I don't think I can last here
    
    I am you and you are me
    We will never be alone
    I have finally found my place in everything
    I have finally found my home
    I can leave all of this flesh behind
    I can see right through this whole facade
    I am becoming something else
    I am a turning into God
    
    My God
    Can it go any faster?
    Oh my God
    I don't think I can last here

Song: Me, I'm Not

    And it's happening
    Never planned on this
    You got something I need
    Kind of dangerous
    And I'm losing control
    I'm not used to this
    What you want from me?
    I'm not used to this
    Can't seem to shut it off
    This thing I've begun
    And it's hard to tell just where it's coming from
    And it's hard to see what I'm capable of
    And it's hard to believe just what I've become
    
    Hey
    Can we stop?
    Me, I'm not
    
    I can swallow it down
    Keep it all inside
    I define myself by how well I hide
    Feel it coming apart
    Well at least I tried
    I can win this war by knowing not to fight
    If I take it all back
    Some way somehow
    If I knew back then
    What I know right now
    
    Hey
    Can we stop?
    Me, I'm not

Song: Capital G

    I pushed a button and elected him to office and uh
    He pushed a button and it dropped a bomb
    You pushed a button and could watch it on the television
    Those motherfuckers didn't last too long, ha ha
    I'm sick of hearing 'bout the haves and the have nots
    Have some personal accountability
    The biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is
    The more we let you have the less that I'll be keeping for me
    
    Well I used to stand for something
    Now I'm on my hands and knees
    Traded in my God for this one
    He signs his name with a Capital G
    
    Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala
    Don't really see what all the fuss is about
    Ain't gonna worry bout no future generations and uh
    I'm sure somebody's gonna figure it out
    Don't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person
    You haven't had enough to know what it's like
    You're only angry 'cause you wish you were in my position
    Now nod your head because you know that I'm right
    All right!
    
    Well I used to stand for something
    But forgot what that could be
    There's a lot of me inside you
    Maybe you're afraid to see
    
    Well I used to stand for something
    Now I'm on my hands and knees
    Traded in my God for this one
    He signs his name with a Capital G

Song: My Violent Heart

    You and I we may look the same
    But we are very far apart
    There's bullet holes where my compassion used to be
    And there is violence in my heart
    Into fire you can send us
    From the fire we return
    You can label us a consequence
    Of how much you have to learn
    
    You can try but you'll never understand
    This is something you will never understand
    Can you hear it now?
    Hear it coming now?
    Can you hear it now?
    
    On hands and knees
    We crawl
    You can not stop us all
    Our bones
    Our skin
    We will not let you in
    
    You have set something in motion
    Much greater than you've ever known
    Standing there in all your grand naivete
    About to reap what you have sown
    Time will feed upon your weaknesses
    And soon you'll lose the will to care
    When you return to the place that you call home
    We will be there
    We will be there
    
    On hands and knees
    We crawl
    You can not stop us all
    Our blood
    Will stay
    We will not go away
    On hands and knees
    We crawl
    You can not stop us all
    Our blood
    Our grace
    Will never leave this place

Song: The Warning

    Some say it was a warning
    Some say it was a sign
    I was standing right there
    When it came down from the sky
    The way it spoke to us
    You felt it from inside
    Said it was up to us
    Up to us to decide
    "You've become a virus
    Killing off his host
    We've been watching you with all of our eyes
    And what you seem to value most
    So much potential
    Or so we used to say
    Your greed, self-importance and your arrogance
    You piss it all away
    We heard her cry
    We have come to intervene
    You will change your ways and you will make amends
    Or we will wipe this place clean"
    
    Your time is ticking away

Song: God Given

    Hey man
    Please don't make a sound
    Take a look around
    Can't you see what's right in front of you?
    Aah
    Have a little taste
    No more time to waste
    You don't wanna get left behind, because it's all coming down right now
    How hard is it to see?
    Put your faith in me
    I sure wouldn't want to be
    Praying to the wrong piece of wood
    You should get where you belong
    Everything you know is wrong
    Come on, sing along
    Everybody now
    
    (God Given)
    And He gives us sight
    And we see the light
    And it burns so bright
    Now we know we're right
    When His kingdom come
    And Thy will be done
    We have just begun
    We're the chosen ones
    
    I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true
    That hadn't come right from His mouth and He wants me to tell you
    
    Wait
    Step into the light
    How can this be right?
    I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave
    Guess you cannot win
    With the color of your skin
    You won't be getting in to the Promised Land
    Besides
    This is just another case
    You people still don't know your place
    Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face
    We are the divine
    Separated from the swine
    Come on, sing along everybody now
    
    (God Given)
    And He gives us sight
    And we see the light
    And it burns so bright
    Now we know we're right
    When His kingdom come
    And Thy will be done
    We have just begun
    We're the chosen ones
    And He gives us sight
    And we see the light
    And it burns so bright
    Now we know we're right
    When His kingdom come
    And Thy will be done
    And the Father and the Holy Son
    We're the chosen ones
    
    I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true
    That hadn't come right from His mouth and He wants me to tell you

Song: Meet Your Master

    Bow down in position
    Against the polished steel
    This is something different
    You'll like the way this feels
    No time for asking questions
    No time for wondering
    We've heard enough from you now
    We've heard everything
    We're going to play a new game
    You'll put on this blindfold
    You'll do what we tell you
    You'll do as you're told
    Used to be the leader
    Now comes the time to serve
    Maybe we show some mercy
    Maybe you get what you deserve 
    
    Count down to the end
    Gotta make it come faster faster
    Right around the bend
    Is a coming disaster
    Count down to the end
    And we're headed there faster
    Come on down my friend
    It's time to meet your master
    
    You've left quite a mess here
    Under your stewardship
    You thought you'd figured it out but
    You'll learn your place in this
    Might take some convincing
    For you to see the truth
    There are so many things
    We've got in store for you
    
    Count down to the end
    Gotta make it come faster faster
    Right around the bend
    Is a coming disaster
    Count down to the end
    And we're headed there faster faster
    Come on down my friend
    It's time to meet your master

    Come on down

Song: The Greater Good

    Breathe us in
    Slowly
    Slowly
    
    Persuasion
    Coercion
    Submission
    Assimilation
    
    Welcome to your new point of view
    We have disappeared into you
    
    Everything you do
    Everywhere you go
    Anything we want
    Anything
    
    Now it's all just a matter of time

Song: The Great Destroyer

    Say your name
    Try to speak as clearly as you can
    You know everything gets written down
    Nod your head
    Just in case they could be watching
    With their shiny satellites
    
    I hope they cannot see
    The limitless potential
    Living inside of me
    To murder everything
    I hope they cannot see
    I am the Great Destroyer
    
    Turn it up
    Listen to the shit they pump into your head
    Filling you with apathy
    Hold your breath
    Wait until you know the time is right
    On time
    The end is near
    
    I hope they cannot see
    The limitless potential
    Living inside of me
    To murder everything
    I hope they cannot see
    I am the Great Destroyer

Song: In This Twilight

    Watch the sun as it crawls across a final time
    And it feels like
    Like it was a friend
    If it's watching us
    And the world we set on fire
    Do you wonder if it feels the same?
    
    And the sky is filled with light
    Can you see it?
    All the black is really white
    If you believe it
    As the time is running out
    Let me take away your doubt
    We can find a better place in this twilight
    
    Dust to dust
    Ashes in your hair remind me     
    What it feels like
    And I won't feel again
    Night descends
    Could I have been a better person?
    If I could only do it all again
    
    But the sky is filled with light
    Can you see it?
    All the black is really white
    If you believe it
    And the longing that you feel
    You know none of this is real
    We will find a better place
    In this twilight

Song: Zero-Sum

    They're starting to open up the sky
    They're starting to reach down through
    And it feels like we're living in that split-second of a car crash
    And time is slowing down
    And if we only had a little more time
    And this time is all there is
    Do you remember the time we
    And all the times we
    And should have
    And were going to
    I know
    And I know you remember
    How we could justify it all
    And we knew better
    In our hearts we knew better
    And we told ourselves it didn't matter
    And we chose to continue
    And none of that matters anymore
    In the hour of our twilight
    And soon it will be all said and done
    And we will all be back together as one
    If we will continue at all
    
    Shame on us
    Doomed from the start   
    May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts
    Shame on us
    For all we have done
    And all we ever were
    Just zeros and ones
    
    And you never get away
    And you never get to take the easy way
    And all of this is a consequence
    Brought on by our own hand
    If you believe in that sort of thing
    And did you ever really find
    When you closed your eyes
    Any place that was still and at peace
    And I guess I just wanted to tell you
    As the light starts to fade
    That you are the reason
    That I am not afraid
    And I guess I just wanted to mention
    As the heavens will fall    
    We will be together soon if we
    Will be anything at all
    
    Shame on us
    Doomed from the start   
    May God have mercy
    On our dirty little hearts
    Shame on us
    For all we have done
    And all we ever were
    Just zeros and ones
