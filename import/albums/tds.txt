Year: 1994

Song: Mr. Self Destruct

    I am the voice inside your head
    And I control you
    I am the lover in your bed
    And I control you
    I am the sex that you provide
    And I control you
    I am the hate you try to hide
    And I control you
    
    I take you where you want to go
    I give you all you need to know
    I drag you down I use you up
    Mr. Self Destruct
    
    I speak religion's message clear
    And I control you
    I am denial guilt and fear
    And I control you
    I am the prayers of the naive
    And I control you
    I am the lie that you believe
    And I control you
    
    I take you where you want to go
    I give you all you need to know
    I drag you down I use you up
    Mr. Self Destruct

    You let me do this to you
    I am an exit
    
    I am the needle in your vein
    And I control you
    I am the high you can't sustain
    And I control you
    I am the pusher
    I'm a whore
    And I control you
    I am the need in you for more
    And I control you
    I am the bullet in the gun
    And I control you
    I am the truth from which you run
    And I control you
    I am the silencing machine
    And I control you
    I am the end of all your dreams
    And I control you
    
    I take you where you want to go
    I give you all you need to know
    I drag you down I use you up
    Mr. Self Destruct

Song: Piggy

    Hey pig
    Yeah you
    Hey pig piggy pig pig pig
    All of my fears came true
    Black and blue and broken bones
    You left me here I'm all alone
    My little piggy needed something new
    
    Nothing can stop me now
    I don't care anymore
    Nothing can stop me now
    I just don't care
    
    Hey pig
    Nothing's turning out the way I planned
    Hey pig there's a lot of things I hoped you could help me understand
    What am I supposed to do
    I lost my shit because of you
    
    Nothing can stop me now
    I don't care anymore
    Nothing can stop me now
    I just don't care
    Nothing can stop me now

Song: Heresy

    He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
    He tries to tell me what I put inside of me
    He's got the answers to ease my curiosity
    He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity
    
    Your God is dead and no one cares
    If there is a Hell I will see you there
    
    He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
    He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
    His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
    Demands devotion
    Atrocities done in his name
    
    Your God is dead and no one cares
    Drowning in his own hypocrisy
    If there is a Hell I will see you there
    Will you die for this?

Song: March of the Pigs

    Step right up
    March
    Push
    Crawl right up on your knees
    Please
    Greed
    Feed
    (no time to hesitate)
    I want a little bit
    I want a piece of it
    I think he's losing it
    I want to watch it come down
    Don't like the look of it
    Don't like the taste of it
    Don't like the smell of it
    I want to watch it come down
    
    All the pigs are all lined up
    I give you all that you want
    Take the skin and peel it back
    Now doesn't that make you feel better?
    
    Shove it up inside
    Surprise
    Lies
    Stains like blood on your teeth
    Bite
    Chew
    Suck away the tender parts
    I want to break it up
    I want to smash it up
    I want to fuck it up
    I want to watch it come down
    Maybe afraid of it
    Let's discredit it
    Let's pick away at it
    I want to watch it come down
    
    All the pigs are all lined up
    I give you all that you want
    Take the skin and peel it back
    Now doesn't that make you feel better?
    The pigs have won tonight
    Now they can all sleep soundly
    And everything is all right

Song: Closer

    You let me violate you
    You let me desecrate you
    You let me penetrate you
    You let me complicate you
    Help me
    I broke apart my insides
    Help me
    I've got no soul to sell
    Help me
    The only thing that works for me
    Help me get away from myself

    I want to fuck you like an animal
    I want to feel you from the inside
    I want to fuck you like an animal
    My whole existence is flawed
    You get me closer to God

    You can have my isolation
    You can have the hate that it brings
    You can have my absence of faith
    You can have my everything
    Help me tear down my reason
    Help me
    It's your sex I can smell
    Help me
    You make me perfect
    Help me become somebody else

    I want to fuck you like an animal
    I want to feel you from the inside
    I want to fuck you like an animal
    My whole existence is flawed
    You get me closer to God

    Through every forest
    Above the trees
    Within my stomach
    Scraped off my knees
    I drink the honey inside your hive
    You are the reason I stay alive

Song: Ruiner

    You had all of them on your side, didn't you?
    You believed in all your lies, didn't you?
    The Ruiner's got a lot to prove
    He's got nothing to lose
    And now he made you believe
    The Ruiner's your only friend
    Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
    The raping of the innocent
    You know the Ruiner ruins everything he sees
    Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease
    
    How did you get so big?
    How did you get so strong?
    How did you get so hard?
    How did it get so long?
    
    You had to give them all a sign, didn't you?
    You had to covet what was mine, didn't you?
    The Ruiner's a collector
    He's an infector
    Serving his shit to his flies
    Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
    Maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go
    And maybe that fucked me up much more than you'll ever know
    
    How did you get so big?
    How did you get so strong?
    How did you get so hard?
    How did it get so long?
    What you gave to me
    My perfect ring of scars
    You know I can see
    What you really are
    
    You didn't hurt me
    Nothing can hurt me
    You didn't hurt me
    Nothing can stop me now

Song: The Becoming

    I beat my machine
    It's a part of me
    It's inside of me
    I'm stuck in this dream
    It's changing me
    I am becoming

    The me that you know had some second thoughts
    He's covered with scabs
    He is broken and sore
    The me that you know doesn't come around much
    That part of me isn’t here anymore
    
    All pain disappears
    It's the nature of my circuitry
    Drowns out all I hear
    No escape from this
    My new consciousness

    The me that you know used to have feelings
    But the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decay
    The me that you know is now made up of wires
    And even when I'm right with you I'm so far away
    
    I can try to get away but I've strapped myself in
    I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears
    I can see it killing away all my bad parts
    I don't want to listen but it's all too clear
    Hiding backwards inside of me
    I feel so unafraid
    Annie, hold a little tighter
    I might just slip away
    
    It won't give up it wants me dead
    Goddamn this noise inside my head

Song: I Do Not Want This

    I'm losing ground
    You know how this world can beat you down
    I'm made of clay
    I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way

    I'm always falling down the same hill
    Bamboo puncturing this skin
    And nothing comes bleeding out of me
    Just like a waterfall I'm drowning in
    2 feet below the surface I can still make out your wavy face
    And if I could just reach you maybe I could leave this place

    I do not want this
    I do not want this
    I do not want this
    I do not want this
    Don't you tell me how I feel
    Don't you tell me how I feel
    Don't you tell me how I feel
    You don't know just how I feel
    
    I stay inside my bed
    I have lived so many lives all in my head
    Don't tell me that you care
    There really isn't anything, now is there?

    You would know, wouldn’t you?
    You extend your hand to those who suffer
    To those who know what it really feels like
    To those who've had a taste
    Like that means something
    And oh so sick I am
    And maybe I don't have a choice
    And maybe that is all I have
    And maybe this is a cry for help

    I do not want this
    I do not want this
    I do not want this
    I do not want this
    Don't you tell me how I feel
    Don't you tell me how I feel
    Don't you tell me how I feel
    You don't know just how I feel
    
    I want to know everything
    I want to be everywhere
    I want to fuck everyone in the world
    I want to do something that matters

Song: Big Man With A Gun

    I am a big man
    (Yes I am)
    And I have a big gun
    Got me a big old dick and I
    I like to have fun
    Held against your forehead
    I'll make you suck it
    Maybe I'll put a hole in your head
    You know, just for the fuck of it
    
    I can reduce you if I want
    I can devour
    I'm hard as fucking steel, and I've got the power
    I'm every inch a man, and I'll show you somehow
    Me and my fucking gun
    Nothing can stop me now
    
    Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
    I'm going to come all over you
    
    Me and my fucking gun
    Me and my fucking gun

Song: Eraser

    Need you
    Dream you
    Find you
    Taste you
    Fuck you
    Use you
    Scar you
    Break you
    Lose me
    Hate me
    Smash me
    Erase me
    Kill me

Song: Reptile

    She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in
    She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she’s been
    She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin
    Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within
    
    Oh my beautiful liar
    Oh my precious whore
    My disease
    My infection
    I am so impure

    Give in
    
    Devils speak of the ways in which she'll manifest
    Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress
    Need to contaminate
    To alleviate this loneliness
    I now know the depths I reach are limitless
    
    Oh my beautiful liar
    Oh my precious whore
    My disease my infection
    I am so impure

Song: The Downward Spiral

    He couldn't believe how easy it was
    He put the gun into his face
    Bang!
    (So much blood for such a tiny little hole)
    
    Problems do have solutions, you know
    A lifetime of fucking things up fixed in one determined flash
    Everything's blue...
    Everything's blue in this world
    The deepest shade of mushroom blue
    All fuzzy
    Spilling out of my head

Song: Hurt

    I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
    I focus on the pain
    The only thing that's real
    The needle tears a hole
    The old familiar sting
    Try to kill it all away
    But I remember everything
    
    What have I become?
    My sweetest friend
    Everyone I know goes away in the end
    You could have it all
    My empire of dirt
    I will let you down
    I will make you hurt
    
    I wear this crown of shit upon my liar's chair
    Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair
    Beneath the stains of time
    The feelings disappear
    You are someone else
    I am still right here
    
    What have I become?
    My sweetest friend
    Everyone I know goes away in the end
    You could have it all
    My empire of dirt
    I will let you down
    I will make you hurt

    If I could start again
    A million miles away
    I would keep myself
    I would find a way
