Song: All The Love In The World

    Watching all the insects march along
    Seem to know just right where they belong
    Smears of face reflecting in the chrome
    Hiding in the crowd I'm all alone
    No one's heard a single word I've said
    They don't sound as good outside my head
    Looks as though the past is here to stay
    I've become a million miles a-
    
    Why do you get all the love in the world?
    
    All the jagged edges disappear
    Colors all look brighter when you're near
    The stars are all afire in the sky
    Sometimes I get so lonely I could
    
    Why do you get all the love in the world?

Song: You Know What You Are?

    I tried to sneak myself through I tried to get to the other side
    I tried to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide
    For a little bit of time even made it work okay
    Just long enough to really make it hurt
    When they figured me out and it all just rotted away
    
    Don't you fucking know what you are?
    Go on get back to where you belong
    
    You better take a good look because I'm full of shit
    With every bit of my heart I have tried to believe in it
    You can dress it all up you can try to pretend
    But you can't change anything
    You can't change anything in the end
    
    Don't you fucking know what you are?
    Go on get back to where you belong
    
    Remember where you came from remember what you are

Song: The Collector

    I pick things up
    I am a collector
    And things, well things
    They tend to accumulate
    I have this net
    It drags behind me
    And it picks up feelings
    For me to feed upon
    
    There are times, plenty of times
    I wish I could let it go
    But they start to breathe
    And they start to grow inside me
    There are times, plenty of times
    I wish I could let it go
    But they start to make me think
    Things I don't want to know
    
    I'm trying to fit it all inside
    I'm trying to open my mouth wide
    I'm trying not to choke and
    Swallow it all
    Swallow it all
    Swallow it all
    Swallow it all
    
    I am the plague
    I am the swarm
    All your hurt sticks on me
    And I keep it warm
    They make me stay
    They won't let me leave
    There are so God damned many of them
    It gets hard to breathe
    
    I'm trying to fit it all inside
    I'm trying to open my mouth wide
    I'm trying not to choke inside
    I am a good boy and
    Will swallow it all
    Swallow it all
    Swallow it all
    Swallow it all
    
    Every last one
    Every last one
    Every last one
    Every last one

Song: The Hand That Feeds

    You're keeping in step
    In the line
    Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
    Because you do
    What you're told
    But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow
    And it's cold
    
    Just how deep do you believe?
    Will you bite the hand that feeds?
    Will you chew until it bleeds?
    Can you get up off your knees?
    Are you brave enough to see
    Do you want to change it?
    
    What if this whole crusade's
    A charade
    And behind it all there's a price to be paid
    For the blood
    On which we dine
    Justified in the name of the holy and the divine
    
    Just how deep do you believe?
    Will you bite the hand that feeds?
    Will you chew until it bleeds?
    Can you get up off your knees?
    Are you brave enough to see?
    Do you want to change it?
    
    So naïve
    To keep holding on to what I want to believe
    And I can see
    But I keep
    Holding on and on and on and on
    
    Will you bite the hand that feeds you or will you stay down on your knees?

Song: Love Is Not Enough

    The more that we take
    The paler we get
    I can't remember what it is
    We try to forget
    The tile on the floor
    So cold it can sting
    In your eyes is a place
    Worth remembering
    For you to go and take this
    To smash it apart
    I've gone all this fucking way
    To wind up
    To wind up back at the start
    
    Hey the closer we think we are
    Well it only got us so far
    Now you got anything left to show?
    No, no, I didn't think so
    Hey, the sooner we realize
    We cover ourselves with lies
    But underneath we're not so tough
    And love is not enough
    
    It hides in the dark
    Like the withering vein
    We didn't give it a mouth
    So it cannot complain
    It never really had a chance
    We'd never really make it through
    And to think I believed
    I believed I could get better with you
    
    Hey the closer we think we are
    Well it only got us so far
    Now you got anything left to show?
    No, no, I didn't think so
    Hey, the sooner we realize
    We cover ourselves with lies
    But underneath we're not so tough
    And love is not enough

Song: Every Day Is Exactly The Same

    I believe I can see the future
    Because I repeat the same routine
    I think I used to have a purpose
    And then again that might have been a dream
    I think I used to have a voice
    Now I never make a sound
    I just do what I've been told
    I really don't want them to come around
    Oh no
    
    Every day is exactly the same
    There is no love here and there is no pain
    Every day is exactly the same
    
    I can feel their eyes are watching
    In case I lose myself again
    Sometimes I think I'm happy here
    Sometimes I still pretend
    I can't remember how this all got started
    But I can tell you —exactly— How it will end
    
    Every day is exactly the same
    Every day is exactly the same
    There is no love here and there is no pain
    Every day is exactly the same
    
    I'm writing on a little piece of paper
    I'm hoping someday you might find
    I'll hide it behind something
    They don't look behind
    I am still inside here
    A little bit comes bleeding through
    I wish this could have been any other way
    I just don't know what else I can do
    
    Every day is exactly the same

Song: With Teeth

    She comes along
    She gets inside
    She makes you better than
    Anything you've tried
    It's in her kiss
    The blackest sea
    It runs deeper than you
    Dare to dream it could be
    
    With teeth
    She's holding on
    With teeth
    
    Wave goodbye
    To what you were
    The rules have changed
    The lines begin to blur
    She makes you hard
    It comes on strong
    You've finally found
    The place where you belong
    
    With teeth
    She is the greatest lie of all
    
    I can not go through this again
    
    With teeth
    She is the greatest lie of all
    
    She will not let you go
    Keeps holding on
    
    This time I'm not coming back

Song: Only

    I'm becoming less defined
    As days go by
    Fading away
    (Well you might say)
    I'm losing focus
    Kind of drifting into the abstract
    In terms of how I see myself
    Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
    
    Less concerned about fitting into the world
    Your world, that is
    Because it doesn't really matter
    Anymore
    None of this really matters anymore
    
    Yes I am alone
    But then again I always was
    As far back as I can tell
    I think maybe it's because
    Because you were never real to begin with
    I just made you up
    To hurt myself
    And it worked
    Yes it did
    
    There is no you
    There is only me
    There is no fucking you
    There is only me
    Only
    
    [Pt. 2]
    Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
    And it turned out to be a scab
    And I had this funny feeling
    Like I just knew it's something bad
    I just couldn't leave alone
    And I kept picking at that scab
    Like it was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
    But I climbed through
    
    And now I'm somewhere I am not supposed to be
    And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
    Now I know why
    And now I know why
    Things aren't as pretty
    On the inside
    
    There is no fucking you
    There is only me
    Only

Song: Getting Smaller

    Getting a little erratic here
    And I don't know who to trust
    I guess they got a way of reading my mind
    I guess I got to adjust
    I got my arms that flip flop flip flop flip
    I got my head on a spring
    Well I thought I got you on my side
    I haven't got fucking anything
    
    I'm just a face in the crowd
    Nothing to worry about
    Not even trying to stand out
    I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
    And I have nothing to say
    It's all been taken away
    I just behave and obey
    I'm afraid I am starting to fade away
    
    I kind of see through the cracks
    When I press up to the wall
    I'm not looking to stand up real high
    I'd be happy to crawl
    I think I'm losing my grip
    But I can still make a fist
    You know I still got my one good arm
    That I can beat—I can beat myself up with
    
    I'm just a face in the crowd
    Nothing to worry about
    Not even trying to stand out
    I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
    And I have nothing to say
    It's all been taken away
    I just behave and obey
    I'm afraid I am starting to fade away
    
    Hey and for what it is worth
    I really used to believe
    That maybe there's some great thing
    That we could achieve
    And now I can't tell the difference
    Or know what to feel
    Between what I've been trying so hard to see
    And what appears to be real
    
    My world is getting smaller every day
    Hey hey hey hey
    And that's OK

Song: Sunspots

    Sunspots cast a glare in my eyes
    Sometimes I forget I'm alive
    I feel it coming and I've got to get out of its way
    I hear it calling and I come cause I can't disobey
    I should not listen and I shouldn't believe but I do
    Yes I do
    
    She turns me on
    She makes it real
    I have to apologize
    For the way I feel
    
    My life it seems has taken a turn
    Why in the name of God would I ever want to return?
    Peel off our skin we're gonna burn what we were to the ground
    Fuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes around
    I want to kill away the rest of what's left and I do
    Yes I do
    
    She turns me on
    She makes it real
    I have to apologize
    For the way I feel
    And nothing can stop me now
    And there is nothing to fear
    And everything I'd ever want
    Is inside of here
    
    Now I just stare into the sun
    And I see everything I've done
    I think I could have been someone
    But I can't stop what has begun
    When everything is said and done
    And there is no place left to run
    I think I used to be someone
    Now I just stare into the sun

Song: The Line Begins To Blur

    There are things that I said I would never do
    There are fears that I cannot believe have come true
    For my soul is too sick and too little and too late
    And my self I have grown too weary to hate
    
    The more I stay in here
    The more it's not so clear
    The more I stay in here
    The more I disappear
    As far as I have gone
    I knew what side I'm on
    But now I'm not so sure
    The line begins to blur
    
    Is there somebody on top of me?
    I don't know, I don't know
    Isn't anybody stopping me?
    I don't know, I don't know
    Well I'm trying to hold my breath
    I don't know, I don't know
    I don’t know
    
    As I lie here and stare
    The fabric starts to tear
    It's far beyond repair
    And I don't really care
    As far as I have gone
    I knew what side I'm on
    But now I'm not so sure
    The line begins to blur

Song: Beside You In Time

    I am all alone this time around
    Sometimes on the side I hear a sound
    Places parallel I know it's you
    Feel the little pieces bleeding through
    This goes on
    And on
    And on
    
    Now that I've decided not to stay
    I can feel me start to fade away
    Everything is back where it belongs
    I will be beside you before long
    This goes on
    And on
    And on
    
    We will never die
    Beside you in time

Song: Right Where It Belongs

    See the animal in his cage that you built
    Are you sure what side you're on?
    Better not look him too closely in the eye
    Are you sure what side of the glass you are on?
    See the safety of the life you have built
    Everything where it belongs
    Feel the hollowness inside of your heart
    And it's all
    Right where it belongs
    
    What if everything around you
    Isn't quite as it seems
    What if all the world you think you know
    Is an elaborate dream?
    And if you look at your reflection
    Is that all you want it to be?
    What if you could look right through the cracks
    Would you find yourself—find yourself afraid to see?
    
    What if all the world's inside of your head
    Just creations of your own?
    Your devils and your gods all the living and the dead
    And you're really all alone
    You can live in this illusion
    You can choose to believe
    You keep looking but you can't find the woods
    While you’re hiding in the trees
    
    What if everything around you
    Isn't quite as it seems
    What if all the world you used to know
    Is an elaborate dream?
    And if you look at your reflection
    Is that all you want it to be?
    What if you could look right through the cracks
    Would you find yourself—find yourself afraid to see?

Song: Home

    Everything is catching up with me
    I awake to find I'm not at all where I should be
    And it feels I'm getting to the end
    And it's hard to figure out what's real and what's pretend
    
    To break from what we're tied to
    God knows how much I've tried to
    And I am still inside you
    And I am still inside you
    
    I escape every now and then
    And to think I find myself back here again and again
    I used to know who I was until you came along
    I return to the only place I've ever felt that I belong
    
    To break from what we're tied to
    God knows how much I've tried to
    And I am still inside you
    And I am still inside you

Song: Non-Entity

    The sky is not the same shade of blue
    Every single thing
    I believe isn't true
    Missing in a maze of monochrome
    How did I get here
    How can I go home?
    
    The echoes in my eyes
    Of all they used to see
    Burning down the world 
    The ashes and debris
    And all that's left of me
    Non-entity
    
    Try to stand in line
    Try to obey
    The ghosts of what I was keep getting in the way
    Staring at the sun
    Blinded by the light
    Now I'm afraid I'm fading out of sight
    
    The echoes in my eyes
    Of all they used to see
    Burning down the world 
    Ashes and debris
    And all that's left of you
    And all that's left of me
    All have washed away
    Non-entity

Song: Not So Pretty Now

    You like to open it up real wide
    Then you let everyone come inside
    There's always something you've got to hide
    So you lied and you lied and you lied
    Make sure you grab everything that you need
    You got a hole that you've got to feed
    Keep trying to fill it all up with your greed
    But it bleeds and it bleeds and it bleeds
    
    Well go take a little more
    We'll scrape you off the floor
    We love you anyhow
    But you're not so pretty now
    A great big superstar
    Is what you think you are
    We love you anyhow
    But you're not so pretty now
    
    Nobody burns quite as bright
    Well goddamn, maybe you're right
    There's always battles left for you to fight
    And you might, you might, you just might
    But there is something I've got to say
    There is a price you're gonna pay
    Try as hard as you can to stay
    You're just fading and fading and fading the fuck away
    
    Well go take a little more
    We'll scrape you off the floor
    We love you anyhow
    But you're not so pretty now
    A great big superstar
    Is what you think you are
    We love you anyhow
    But you're not so pretty now
    
    Well go take a little more
    We'll scrape you off the floor
    We love you anyhow
    But you're not so pretty now
    A great big superstar
    Is what you think you are
    We love you anyhow
    But you're not so pretty now
    Better turn the lights down low
    The cracks begin to show
    We all love you anyhow
    But you're not so pretty now
    Well soon you will be gone
    And we will all move on
    You never mattered anyhow
    And you're not so pretty now
