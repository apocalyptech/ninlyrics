Year: 1999

Song: Somewhat Damaged

    So impressed with all you do
    Tried so hard to be like you
    Flew too high and burnt the wing
    Lost my faith in everything
    
    Lick around divine debris
    Taste the wealth of hate in me
    Shedding skin succumb defeat
    This machine is obsolete
    
    Made the choice to go away
    Drink the fountain of decay
    Tear a hole exquisite red
    Fuck the rest and stab it dead
    
    Broken bruised forgotten sore
    Too fucked up to care anymore
    Poisoned to my rotten core
    Too fucked up to care anymore
    
    In the back
    Off the side and far away
    Is a place where I hide
    Where I stay
    Tried to say
    Tried to ask
    I needed to
    All alone
    By myself
    Where were you?

    How could I ever think it's funny how
    Everything that swore it wouldn't change is different now
    Just like you would always say
    We'll make it through
    Then my head fell apart
    And where were you?

    How could I ever think it's funny how
    Everything you swore would never change is different now
    Like you said
    You and me
    Make it through
    Didn't quite
    Fell apart
    Where the fuck were you?

Song: The Day The World Went Away

    I'd listen to the words he'd say
    But in his voice I heard decay
    The plastic face forced to portray
    All the insides left cold and gray
    There is a place that still remains
    It eats the fear it eats the pain
    The sweetest price he'll have to pay
    The day the whole world went away
    
    Na na nah
    Na na na, nah
    Na na nah
    Na na na, nah

Song: The Wretched

    Just a reflection
    Just a glimpse
    Just a little reminder
    Of all the what abouts
    And all the might have
    Could have beens
    Another day
    Some other way
    But not another reason to continue
    And now you're one of us
    The Wretched
    
    The hopes and prays
    The better days
    The far aways
    Forget it
    
    It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
    It didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it?
    It didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
    It didn't turn out the way you wanted it, did it?
    
    Now you know
    This is what it feels like
    Now you know
    This is what it feels like
    
    The clouds will part
    And the sky cracks open
    And God Himself
    Will reach His fucking arm through
    Just to push you down
    Just to hold you down
    Stuck in this hole
    With the shit and the piss
    And it's hard to believe
    It could come down to this
    Back at the beginning
    Sinking
    Spinning
    
    And in the end
    We still pretend
    The time we spend
    Not knowing when
    You're finally free
    And you could be
    
    But it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to
    It didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it
    
    Now you know
    This is what it feels like
    Now you know
    This is what it feels like
    
    You can try to stop it but it keeps on coming
    You can try to stop it but

Song: We're In This Together

    I've become impossible
    Holding on to when
    When everything seemed to matter more
    The two of us
    All used and beaten up
    Watching fate as it flows down the path we have chose
    
    You and me
    We're in this together now
    None of them can stop us now
    We will make it through somehow
    You and me
    If the world should break in two
    Until the very end of me
    Until the very end of you
    
    Awake to the sound as they peel apart the skin
    They pick and they pull
    Trying to get their fingers in
    Well they've got to kill what we found
    Well they've got to hate what they fear
    Well they've got to make it go away
    Well they've got to make it disappear
    
    The farther I fall I'm beside you
    As lost as I get I will find you
    The deeper the wound I'm inside you
    Forever and ever I am a part of
    
    You and me
    We're in this together now
    None of them can stop us now
    We will make it through somehow
    You and me
    If the world should break in two
    Until the very end of me
    Until the very end of you
    
    All that we were is gone
    We have to hold on
    All that we were is gone
    We have to hold on
    When all our hope is gone
    We have to hold on
    All that we were is gone
    But we can hold on
    
    You and me
    We're in this together now
    None of them can stop us now
    We will make it through somehow
    You and me
    Even after everything
    You're the queen and I'm the king
    Nothing else means anything

Song: The Fragile

    She shines
    In a world full of ugliness
    She matters
    When everything is meaningless
    
    Fragile
    She doesn't see her beauty
    She tries to get away
    Sometimes
    It's just that nothing seems worth saving
    I can't watch her slip away
    
    I won't let you fall apart
    
    She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
    Hoping someone can see
    If I could fix myself I'd
    But it's too late for me
    
    I won't let you fall apart
    
    We'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
    We'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side
    But they keep waiting
    And picking
    
    It's something I have to do
    I was there, too
    Before everything else
    I was like you

Song: Even Deeper

    I woke up today
    To find myself in another place
    With a trail of my footprints
    From where I ran away
    Seems everything I heard just might be true
    And you know me
    (Well you think you do)
    Sometimes, I have everything
    Yet I wish I felt something
    
    Do you know how far this has gone?
    Just how damaged have I become?
    When I think I can overcome
    It runs even deeper
    
    In a dream I'm a different me
    With a perfect you
    We fit perfectly
    And for once in my life I feel complete
    And I still want to ruin it
    Afraid to look
    As clear as day
    This plan has long been underway
    I hear them call
    I cannot stay
    The voice inviting me away
    
    Do you know how far this has gone?
    Just how damaged have I become?
    When I think I can overcome
    It runs even deeper
    Everything that matters is gone
    All the hands of hope have withdrawn
    Could you try to help me hang on
    It runs
    
    I'm straight
    I won't crack
    On my way
    And I can't turn back
    I'm okay
    I'm on track
    On my way
    And I can't turn back
    I stayed
    On this track
    Gone too far
    And I can't come back
    I stayed
    On this track
    Lost my way
    Can't come back

Song: No, You Don't

    Smiling in their faces
    While filling up the hole
    So many dirty little places
    In your filthy little worn out
    Broken down see through soul
    
    Baby's got a problem
    Tries so hard to hide
    Got to keep it on the surface
    Because everything else is dead on the other side
    
    Teeth in the necks of everyone you know
    You can keep on sucking until the blood won't flow
    When it starts to hurt it only helps it grow
    Taking all you need
    (But not this time)
    No, you don't
    
    And just for the record
    Just so you know
    I did not believe
    That you could sink so low
    
    You think that you can beat them
    I know that you won't
    You think you have everything
    But no, you don't
    
    No, you don't
    No, you don't
    No, you don't
    No, you don't

Song: La Mer

    And when the day arrives
    I'll become the sky
    And I'll become the sea
    
    And the sea will come to kiss me
    For I am going
    Home
    
    Nothing can stop me now

Song: The Great Below

    Staring at the sea
    Will she come?
    Is there hope for me
    After all is said and done
    Anything at any price
    All of this for you
    All the spoils of a wasted life
    All of this for you
    All the world has closed her eyes
    Tired faith all worn and thin
    For all we could have done
    And all that could have been
    
    Ocean pulls me close
    And whispers in my ear
    The destiny I've chose
    All becoming clear
    The currents have their say
    The time is drawing near
    Washes me away
    Makes me disappear
    I descend from grace
    In arms of undertow
    I will take my place
    In the great below
    
    I can still feel you
    Even so far away

Song: Into the Void

    Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
    
    Talking to myself all the way to the station
    Pictures in my head of the final destination
    All lined up
    (All the ones that aren't allowed to stay)
    Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
    
    Tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches
    Tried to overcome the complications and the catches
    Nothing ever grows and the sun doesn't shine all day
    Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
    
    Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

Song: Where Is Everybody?

    Did you happen to catch
    Or did it happen so fast
    What you thought would always last
    Has passed you by
    Is everything speeding up
    Or am I slowing down
    Just spinning around
    And I don't know why
    All the pieces don't fit
    Thought I really didn't give a shit
    I never wanted to be like you
    But for all I aspire
    I am really a liar
    And I'm running out of things I can do
    
    I'd like to stay
    But every day
    Everything pushes me further away
    If you could show
    Help me to know
    How it's supposed to be
    Where did it go?
    
    Pleading and
    Needing and
    Bleeding and
    Breeding and
    Feeding
    Exceeding
    Where is everybody?
    Trying and
    Lying
    Defying
    Denying
    Crying and
    Dying
    Where is everybody?
    
    Well, okay, enough
    You've had your fun
    But come on there has got to be someone
    That hasn't yet become
    So numb
    And succumb
    And God damn I am so tired of pretending
    Of wishing I was ending
    When all I'm really doing is trying to hide
    And keep it inside
    And fill it with lies
    Open my eyes?
    Maybe I wish I could try
    
    Pleading and
    Needing and
    Bleeding and
    Breeding and
    Feeding
    Exceeding
    Where is everybody?
    Trying and
    Lying
    Defying
    Denying
    Crying and
    Dying
    Where is everybody?

Song: Please

    This is how it begins
    Push it away but it all comes back again
    All the flesh
    All the sin
    There was a time when it used to mean just about everything
    
    Just like now
    
    Breathe
    Echoing the sound
    Time starts slowing down
    Sink until I drown
    (Please) I don't ever want to make it stop
    
    And it keeps repeating
    Will you please complete me?
    
    Never be enough
    To fill me up
    
    Watch the white turn to red
    It fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead
    All my life
    Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me dead
    (Well guess what?)
    The world is over and I realized it was all in my head
    
    Now everything is clear
    I erase the fear
    I can disappear
    (Please) I don't ever want to make it stop
    
    You can never leave me
    Will you please complete me?
    
    Never be enough
    To fill me up

Song: Starfuckers, Inc.

    My god sits in the back of the limousine
    My god comes in a wrapper of cellophane
    My god pouts on the cover of the magazine
    My god's a shallow little bitch trying to make the scene
    
    I have arrived and this time you should believe the hype
    I listened to everyone
    Now I know that everyone was right
    I'll be there for you as long as it works for me
    I play a game
    It's called insincerity
    
    Starfuckers
    Starfuckers
    Starfuckers, Inc.
    Starfuckers
    
    I am every fucking thing and just a little more
    I sold my soul but don't you dare call me a whore
    And when I suck you off not a drop will go to waste
    It's really not so bad you know once you get past the taste
    (Asskisser)
    
    Starfuckers
    Starfuckers
    Starfuckers, Inc.
    Starfuckers
    
    All our pain
    How did we ever get by without you?
    You're so vain
    I bet you think this song is about you
    Don't you?
    Don't you?
    Don't you?
    Don't you?
    
    Now I belong I'm one of the chosen ones
    Now I belong I'm one of the beautiful ones

Song: I'm Looking Forward To Joining You, Finally

    As black as the night can get
    Everything is safer now
    There's always a way to forget
    Once you learn to find a way how
    
    In the blur of serenity
    Where did everything get lost?
    The flowers of naivete
    Buried in a layer of frost
    
    The smell of sunshine
    I remember sometimes
    
    Thought he had it all before they called his bluff
    Found out that his skin just wasn't thick enough
    Wanted to go back to how it was before
    Thought he lost everything
    Then he lost a whole lot more
    
    A fool's devotion
    Swallowed up in empty space
    The tears of regret
    Frozen to the side of his face
    
    The smell of sunshine
    I remember sometimes
    
    I've done all I can do
    Could I please come with you?
    Sweet smell of sunshine
    I remember sometimes

Song: The Big Come Down

    There is a game I play
    Try to make myself okay
    Try so hard to make the pieces all fit
    Smash it apart
    Just for the fuck of it
    
    Bye bye oooh
    Got to get back to the bottom
    Bye bye oooh
    The big come down
    Isn't that what you wanted?
    Bye bye oooh
    Find a place with the failed and forgotten
    Bye bye oooh
    Isn't that really what you wanted now?
    
    There is no place I can go
    There is no way I can hide
    It feels like it keeps coming from the inside
    
    There is a hate that burns within
    The most desperate place I have ever been
    Try to get back to where I'm from
    The closer I get the worse it becomes
    The closer I get the worse it becomes
    
    There is no place I can go
    There is no place I can hide
    It feels like it keeps coming from the inside

Song: Underneath It All

    All I do
    I can still feel you
    
    Numb all through
    I can still feel you
    Hear your call
    Underneath it all
    Kill my brain
    Yet you still remain
    Crucified
    After all I've died
    After all I've tried
    You are still inside
    
    All I do
    I can still feel you
    
    You remain
    I am stained

Song: 10 Miles High

    I'm getting closer
    All the time
    
    I tried to get so high

    I'm going to get so high
    You'll never get inside
    I swore I'd never turn into you
    I'm closer all the time
    
    I made it 10 miles high
    Can't tell my truth from my lies
    I swore to god I would never turn into you
    I'm getting closer all the time
    
    Tear it all down
    Tear it all down
    Tear it all down
    Tear it all down

    My nightmare's everywhere but inside
    A living indication of every situation
    But it seems I have neglected complication
    Hindered my salvation
    But I try and I try and I try

Song: The New Flesh

    I can take it
    Sideways
    Sometimes
    Some things feel like
    I'm on the other side
    Waves of every feeling ever felt
    screaming
    
    Hold it close
    So I can taste it
    
    I've watched this scene a thousand times
    And in my head
    This is how it all begins
    Yes, I am becoming
    And this is how it all begins
    What did you expect?
    This is not an exit
    This has begun
    
    I can almost see
    The blackest eyes
    The new flesh
    A new disguise
    Welcoming
    
    Please
    
    Give it to me
    I can take it
    Give it to me
     
    I can take it

Song: And All That Could Have Been

    Breeze still carries the sound
    Maybe I'll disappear
    Tracks will fade in the snow
    You won't find me here
    
    Ice is starting to form
    Ending what had begun
    I am locked in my head with what I've done
    I know you tried to rescue me
    Didn't let anyone get in
    Left with a trace of all that was
    And all that could have been
    
    Please take this
    And run far away
    Far away from me
    I am tainted
    The two of us
    Were never meant to be
    All these pieces
    And promises and left behinds
    If only I could see
    In my nothing
    You meant everything
    Everything to me
    Gone fading everything
    And all that could have been
    
    Please take this
    And run far away
    Far as you can see
    I am tainted
    And happiness and peace of mind
    Were never meant for me
    All these pieces
    And promises and left behinds
    If only I could see
    In my nothing
    You meant everything
    Everything to me

Song: Deep

    Blank stare
    Disrepair
    There's a big black hole gonna eat me up someday
    Someday fades away like a memory
    Or a place that you'd rather be
    Some place
    Lost in space
    Itch in my head that's telling me somewhere
    Somewhere out there, anywhere
    I don't care
    Get me out of here

    If I could feel all the pins and the pricks
    If you were real
    I could take what's apart and put it back together

    This will come true
    Help me get through
    Into you
    Deep
    All I can do
    Driving me through
    Into you
    Deep

    One track, got you on your back
    Your skin speaks up but your lips couldn't say it
    Right now
    I know somehow
    We could take the chance and we could make it (make it)
    Right here make it all disappear
    Everything that we've been missing, missing
    You make me feel
    That there's a part of me
    That I want to get back again

    Make this come true
    Help me get through
    Into you
    Deep
    All I can do
    Pushing it through
    Into you
    Deep

    All I can do
    Driving on through
    Into you
    Deep 
    You're slipping through
    I'm coming to
    Into you
    Deep
    We could become
    Two into one
    Leave this behind
    Over and done
    Everything new
    I'm getting through
    Into you

Song: The Perfect Drug

    I got my head but my head is unraveling
    Can't keep control
    Can't keep track of where it's traveling
    I got my heart but my heart's no good
    You're the only one that's understood

    I come along but I don't know where you're taking me
    I shouldn't go but you're wrenching dragging shaking me
    Turn off the sun
    Pull the stars from the sky
    The more I give to you the more I die

    And I want you

    You are the perfect drug
    The perfect drug
    The perfect drug
    The perfect drug

    You make me hard when I'm all soft inside
    I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed
    The arrow goes straight through my heart
    Without you everything just falls apart

    My blood just wants to say hello to you
    My fear is warm to get inside of you
    My soul is so afraid to realize
    How very little bit is left of me

    Take me with you
    Without you everything just falls apart
    It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
