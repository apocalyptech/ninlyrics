Album: Broken
Year: 1992

Song: Wish

    This is the first day of my last days
    I built it up now I take it apart climbed up real high now fall down real far
    No need for me to stay the last thing left I just threw it away
    I put my faith in God and my trust in you
    Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do
    
    Wish there was something real wish there was something true
    Wish there was something real in this world full of you
    
    I'm the one without a soul I'm the one with this big fucking hole
    No new tale to tell twenty-six years on my way to Hell
    Gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck
    Don't think you're having all the fun
    You know me I hate everyone
    
    Wish there was something real wish there was something true
    Wish there was something real in this world full of you
    
    I want to but I can't turn back
    But I want to

Song: Last

    Gave up trying to figure it out my head got lost along the way
    Worn out from giving it up my soul I pissed it all away
    Still stings these shattered nerves
    Pigs we get what pigs deserve
    I'm going all the way down I'm leaving today
    
    Come come on you've gotta fill me up
    Come come gotta let me inside of you
    Come come come on you've gotta fix me up
    Come come gotta let me inside of you
    
    Still feel it all slipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
    Everybody's still chipping away but it doesn't matter anymore
    Look though these blackened eyes
    You'll see ten thousand lies
    My lips may promise but my heart is a whore
    
    Come come come on you've gotta fix me up
    Come come gotta let me inside of you
    Come come come on you've gotta fill me up
    Come come gotta let me get through to you
    
    This isn't meant to last
    This is for right now
    
    I know it's all getting away and it comes to me as no surprise
    I know what's coming to me is never going to arrive
    Fresh blood through tired skin
    New sweat to drown me in
    Dress up this rotten carcass just to make it look alive
    
    Come come come on you've gotta fill me up
    Come come gotta let me inside of you
    Come come come on you've gotta fix me up
    Come come gotta let me get through to you
    
    This isn't meant to last
    This is for right now
    I wish I could put the blame on you
    
    I want you to make me
    I want you to take me
    I want you to break me
    Then I want you to throw me away

Song: Happiness in Slavery

    Slave screams he thinks he knows what he wants
    Slave screams thinks he has something to say
    Slave screams he hears but doesn't want to listen
    Slave screams he's being beat into submission
    
    Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see
    The devils of truth steal the souls of the free
    Don't open your eyes, take it from me
    I have found
    You can find
    Happiness in slavery
    
    Slave screams he spends his life learning conformity
    Slave screams he claims he has his own identity
    Slave screams he's going to cause the system to fall
    Slave screams but he's glad to be chained to that wall
    
    Don't open your eyes you won't like what you see
    The blind have been blessed with security
    Don't open your eyes, take it from me
    I have found
    You can find
    Happiness in slavery
    
    I don't know what I am I don't know where I've been
    Human junk just words and so much skin
    Stick my hands through the cage of this endless routine
    Just some flesh caught in this big broken machine

    Happiness
    It controls you

Song: Gave Up

    Perfect little dream the kind that hurts the most
    Forgot how it feels well almost
    No one to blame always the same
    Open my eyes wake up in flames
    
    It took you to make me realize
    It took you to make me realize
    It took you to make me realize
    It took you to make me see the light
    Smashed up my sanity
    Smashed up integrity
    Smashed up what I believed in
    Smashed up what's left of me
    Smashed up my everything
    Smashed up all that was true
    Gonna smash myself to pieces
    I don't know what else to do
    
    Covered in hope and Vaseline
    Still cannot fix this broken machine
    Watching the hole it used to be mine
    Just watching it burn in my steady systematic decline
    Of the trust I will betray
    Give it to me I throw it away
    After everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become
    
    I tried
    I gave up
    I don't know
    Throw it away
