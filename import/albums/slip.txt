Album: The Slip
Year: 2008

Song: 1,000,000

   Kind of hard
   Hard to see
   When you crawl on your hands and your knees
   With your face in the trough
   Wait your turn while they finish you off
   Don't know when it started
   Don't know how
   Should have found out
   Should have happened by now
   Got these lines on my face
   After all this time
   And I still haven't found my place
    
   I jump from every rooftop
   So high
   So far to fall
   I feel a million miles away 
   I don't feel any thing at all
   
   I wake up on the floor
   Start it up again
   Like it matters anymore
   I don't know if it does
   Is this really all that there ever was?
   Put the gun in my mouth
   Close your eyes
   Blow my fucking brains out
   Pretty patterns on the floor
   That's enough for you
   But I still need more
   
   I jump from every rooftop
   So high so far to fall
   I feel a million miles away 
   I don't feel any thing at all

Song: Letting You

   The sky is painted black
   The smoke pours out the stack
   One hand upon your heart
   One hand behind your back
   You train us how to act
   You keep the fear intact
   The imminent attack
   Everything is right on track
   
   And we are letting you get away
   We are letting you get away with it
   
   Upon our plates to feed
   The dying left to bleed 
   How much we really need
   Your politics of greed
   The cancer takes ahold
   The wolf is in the fold
   Our destiny's been sold
   We do just what we're told
   
   And we are letting you get away
   We are letting you get away with it
   
   Your armies filled with hate
   Believing your charade
   Begin to suffocate
   For us it's far too late
   
   And we are letting you get away
   We are letting you get away with it

Song: Discipline

    Am I still tough enough?
    Feels like I'm wearing down
    Is my viciousness losing ground?
    Am I taking too much
    Did I cross a line
    I need my role in this very clearly defined
    I need your discipline
    I need your help
    I need your discipline
    You know once I start I cannot help myself
    
    And now it's starting up
    feels like I'm losing touch
    Nothing matters to me
    Nothing matters as much
    I see you left a mark up and down my skin
    I don't know where I end
    And where you begin
    I need your discipline
    I need your help
    I need your discipline
    You know once I start I cannot help myself
    Once I start I cannot stop myself

Song: Echoplex

    Nice and high and far apart
    Just like they said
    I built this place with broken parts
    Just like they said
    You chip away the old version of you
    You'd be surprised at what you can do
    I'm safe in here  
    Irrelevant  
    Just like they said
    
    My voice just echoes off these walls
    
    You feel me breathe 
    I am watching you
    I see it all
    The many ways you can't get to me
    I see it all
    I see the Hell you put yourself through
    Oh the things I could do (if I wanted to)
    
    My voice just echoes off these walls
    My voice just echoes off these walls
    I don't need anything at all
    My voice just echoes off these walls 
    
    And I just slowly fade away
    
    You will never ever get to me in here

Song: Head Down

   You
   What you looking at?
   Head down
   Too late for that
   What you want
   What you get
   Know your place
   Don't ever forget
     
   And this is not my face
   And this is not my life 
   And there is not a single thing here I can recognize
   This is all a dream
   And none of you are real
   I'll give anything
   I'll give anything 
   
   Hey you
   What you running from?
   All your hate
   What you've become
   Bet you didn't think
   It would happen to you
   All used up
   Half way through
   
   And this is not my face
   And this is not my life 
   And there is not a single thing here
   I can recognize
   This is all a dream
   And none of you are real
   I'll give anything
   I'll give anything 

Song: Lights In The Sky

   She's mostly gone
   Some other place
   I'm getting by in other ways
   Everything they whispered in our ear is coming true
   Try to justify the things I used to do
   Believe in you 
   
   Watching you drown
   I'll follow you down
   I am here right beside you
   The lights in the sky have finally arrived
   I am staying right beside you
   
   I tried to stay away
   Just in case
   I've come to realize
   We all have our place
   Time has a way you know 
   To make it clear
   I have my role in this
   I can't disappear
   Or leave you here
   
   Watching you drown
   I'll follow you down
   I am here right beside you
   The lights in the sky
   Are waving goodbye
   I am staying right beside you

Song: Demon Seed

   It keeps growing 
   And I can feel it breathe 
   I have been trying 
   To behave myself
   It keeps growing 
   And I can feel it breathe 
   I have been trying 
   To tolerate you
   
   Well I am reaching the point
   Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
   
   I will use my voice 
   And I will use my fist 
   To destroy 
   Everything I can
   
   Now I know what this is all about
   Now I know exactly what I am
   
   There is a seed inside of me
